# blogsmatter
Enable a developer, or anyone, to post a blog about a specific topic and allow others to make comments on it.


## PSEUDO-CODE This Thing
Creating directories within the convention of MVC (Model-View-Control)
- controllers, views, models folders
- server.js
### MODELS
- Setting up your database
- index to tie it all together
- User, Post, Comments (Users <-> Posts/Comments one to many relationships)
    - User -> id, username, password
        - encrypt password, need some hooks
    - Post -> id, title, description, date/timestamp(sequelize can do this for you, research!), fk_user_id
    - Comments -> id, description, fk_post_id, fk_user_id
### VIEWS
- handlebarsjs
- login/signup, homepage, dashboard, post(comments/newcomment-partial), new-post(edit-post)
- folders for layouts and partials if you plan to use them
    - layouts main? partials post/comment?
### CONTROLLERS
- routes! /api/ and home
- index -> apiroutes, homeroutes
- homeroutes -> (get) '/', '/login/', '/post/:id', '/user/:id'(for the dashboard)
- /api/ index, user, (blog)post, comments
    - get, post, put, delete
    - index -> userroutes, postroutes, commentroutes
    - (blog)post -> :id, title, description, (includes user)
    - user -> :id, username, password
    - comments -> :id, description (includes post/user), could do post.includes(comments)
### Basics
- server file, .env, .gitignore, readme
- public (css, img, js)
- config(connection)
- db(schema)
- seeds(index, postData?, commentData?)
- utils(auth, helpers)
### SERVER
- NPMs: path, express, express-session, express-handlebars, sequelize, dotenv, 
- middleware: 
    - app.use express.json/urlencoded/static(public)
    - engine, handlebars, helpers, session
- session: secret, cookie
